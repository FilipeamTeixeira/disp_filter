# dispfilter

Disparity filter is a network reduction algorithm, developed by M. Angeles Serrano, Marian Boguna and Alessandro Vespignani to extract the backbone structure of undirected weighted network.

Given an weighted the filter can sufficiently reduce the network without destroying its multi-scale nature.
